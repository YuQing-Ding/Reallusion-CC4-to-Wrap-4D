# Wrap4D-to-CC4
## What is this?
A Warp 4D template for Reallusion Character Creator 4, converted from a model obtained through 3D or 4D scanning.
## What is Warp 4D?
A 3D topology software developed by the Russian company Russian3DScanner (R3DS), mainly used for topology of humans or other creatures.
Here is the official website of R3DS: https://www.russian3dscanner.com/wrap4d/
## What does this template do?
It allows you to quickly and effortlessly topology 3D Scan head or body to CC4 model (of course, I have done it all for you, otherwise, there would be no point in releasing this thing), and it is reusable!

Currently, this template supports:

√ Topologizing 3D or 4D scanned human faces or character models into CC4 compliant models (supports male, female)  

√ Extracting textures from the original 3D or 4D scan data and mapping them to the CC4 standard model.  

√ Comes with a Brush node for post-topology processing, such as smoothing.
